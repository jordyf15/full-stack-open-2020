## Live Demo on Codepen


## Technologies Used
1. Html
2. Javascript
3. React version ^16.14.0

## Exercises Development
1. Exercise 1.6 or Step 1:  
In the first exercise or step 1 we have to make the application able to display the feedbacks and also have a button to add the feedback such as good,bad, or neutral.
2. Exercise 1.7 or Step 2:  
In the second exercise we have to expand the application by adding 2 more statistic, the average and positivity.
3. Exercise 1.8 or Step 3:   
In the third exercise we have to refactor our application so that the part that display all of its statistic are put into a different component called statistics.
4. Exercise 1.9 or Step 4:
In the fourth exercise we have to change our statistics component so that it will only display the statistics if there is already atleast one feedback. If not then just display 'No feedback given'.
5. Exercise 1.10 or Step 5:  
In the fifth exercise we have to refactor our application again so there is a Button component for the feedback button(good,bad,neutral) and also a Statistic component to display each single statistic (e.g neutral).
6. Exercise 1.11 or Step 6:
In the sixth exercise we have to put the statistics into an HTML table so the display is more neat.
