# Course Information
This application will be developed through exercises 2.1-2.5. Here we will create an application that are able to render any amount of courses, any amount of parts a courses may have, and the total of exercises in a course. This application is created with the create-react-app and also the part 1 Model Answer as a starting point or we could use our previous Course Information project on part 1.
