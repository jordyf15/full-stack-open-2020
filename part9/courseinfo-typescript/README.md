## Exercises Development
1. Exercises 9.14 or Step 1:  
In step 1 we have to create a new react app with typescript and set up eslint for the project just like shown in the material. Using the codebase in the exercise the whole app is in one components, so we have to refactor the app so that it consists of three components: Header, Content and Total. All data is still kept in the App component, which passes all necessary data to each component as props.
2. Exercises 9.15 or Step 2:  
In step 2 we the data about courseParts have been altered, so we have to create interfaces that could support all the changes that happended to the data.
