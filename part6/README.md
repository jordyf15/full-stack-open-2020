# Part 6
Part 6 consist of 4 sections:  
1. Flux-architecture and Redux:  
In this section we will learn about the flux architecture where the states is seperated completely from the React-components into its own stores this was to make stage management easier. In this section we will learn and use redux which works with the same principle with flux but is a bit simpler. We will also learn about reducers and action creators.
2. Many reducers:  
In this section we will learn about combined reducers to handle store with complex states, we will also learn about redux devtools.
3. Communicating with server in a redux application:  
In this section we will learn about redux thunk which is a redux middle ware that will allow us to make asynchronous action creators that can also handle the communication with the server.
4. connect:  
In this section we will learn about the connect function which is an older method to share the redux store to components, we will also learn about the mapStatetoProps and mapDispatch to props function that which will define the props of components based on the store and passed action creators to as props to the components.

## Exercises
There are 2 applications that we will developed through exercise 6.1-6.21 in part 6. Here will be displayed link to the live demo of the application in repl. For the source code can be viewed in the application's directory.
